# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to use Tableau for visualization in order to transform complex data into clear, insightful visual representations, enabling easy interpretation, trend identification, and meaningful analysis for storytelling purposes.

## Process
I used the dataset titled 'Causes of Death - Our World In Data' sourced from Kaggle. The dataset can be accessed at [Kaggle - Causes of Death - Our World In Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ivanchvez/causes-of-death-our-world-in-data?resource=download).


## Questoins 
## Research Questions:

1. What are the top causes of death globally and in specific countries?
2. How have these causes changed over the years?
3. Can we predict future trends in causes of death using historical data?
4. Are there any unexpected patterns or outliers in the dataset? 



## Challenges 
1. Finding patterns
2. Finding correlations
   
## Future Goals
Join more tables to the current dataset.
