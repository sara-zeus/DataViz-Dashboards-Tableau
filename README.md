# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to use Tableau for visualization in order to transform complex data into clear, insightful visual representations, enabling easy interpretation, trend identification, and meaningful analysis for storytelling purposes.

## Process
I used the Kaggle website: Cause of Death - Our World In Data. [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ivanchvez/causes-of-death-our-world-in-data?resource=download] 

## Questoins 
What are the top causes of death globally and in specific countries?
How have these causes changed over the years?
Are there any correlations between measures and causes of death? 
Can we predict future trends in causes of death using historical data?
Are there any unexpected patterns or outliers in the dataset? 


## Challenges 


## Future Goals
Join more tables to the current dataset.
